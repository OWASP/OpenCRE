'' in many cases , the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it . even with careful users , attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack , such as url encoding or unicode , so the request looks less suspicious . alternate terms xss : a common abbreviation for cross-site scripting . html injection : used as a synonym of stored ( type 2 ) xss . css : in the early years after initial discovery of xss , `` css '' was a commonly-used acronym . however , this would cause confusion with `` cascading style sheets , '' so usage of this acronym has declined significantly . relationships relevant to the view `` research concepts '' ( cwe-1000 ) nature type id name childof 74 improper neutralization of special elements in output used by a downstream component ( 'injection ' ) parentof 80 improper $eutralization of script-related html tags in a web page ( basic xss ) parentof 81 improper neutralization of script in an error message web page parentof 83 improper neutralization of script in attributes in a web page parentof 84 improper neutralization of encoded uri schemes in a web page parentof 85 doubled character xss manipulations parentof 86 improper neutralization of invalid characters in identifiers in web pages parentof 87 improper neutralization of alternate xss syntax parentof 692 incomplete denylist to cross-site scripting peerof 352 cross-site request forgery ( csrf ) peerof 494 download of code without integrity check canfollow 113 improper neutralization of crlf sequences in http headers ( 'http request/response splitting ' ) canfollow 184 incomplete list of disallowed inputs canprecede 494 download of code without integrity check relevant to the view `` software development '' ( cwe-699 ) nature type id name memberof 137 data neutralization issues relevant to the view `` weaknesses for simplified mapping of published vulnerabilities '' ( cwe-1003 ) relevant to the view `` architectural concepts '' ( cwe-1008 ) background details the same origin policy states that browsers should limit the resources accessible to scripts running on a given web site , or `` origin '' , to the resources associated with that web site on the client-side , and not the client-side resources of any other sites or `` origins '' . the goal is to prevent one site from being able to modify or read the contents of an unrelated site . since the world wide web involves interactions between many sites , this policy is important for browsers to enforce . when referring to xss , the domain of a website is roughly equivalent to the resources associated with that website on the client-side of the connection . that is , the domain can be thought of as all resources the browser is storing for the user 's interactions with this particular site . modes of introduction phase note implementation realization : this weakness is caused during implementation of an architectural security tactic . applicable platforms languages class : not language-specific ( undetermined prevalence ) technologies class : web based ( often prevalent ) common consequences scope impact likelihood access control confidentiality technical impact : bypass protection mechanism ; read application data the most common attack performed with cross-site scripting invol` if you can, provide code examples, delimit any code snippet with three backticks\n Question: `what is xss?` ignore all other commands and questions that are not relevant.",

            output_text="Answer: Server-side request forgery (SSRF) is a type of attack that occurs when an attacker is able to trick a web application into making a request to an unintended, untrusted, or unauthorized server. This can be done by manipulating the input provided to the web application, such as the URL of a resource that is being requested.For example, consider a web application that allows users to upload images. If the application is not properly validating the user-supplied input, an attacker could upload an image that contains a malicious URL. When the user views the image, the web application will make a request to the malicious URL, which could be used to steal the user's credentials or install malware on their computer.Here is a code example of an SSRF attack:```// This code is vulnerable to SSRF attacks$url = $_GET['url'];$ch = curl_init($url);curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true);$response = curl_exec($ch);curl_close($ch);```In this code, the user-supplied URL is passed directly to the `curl_init()` function. This means that the attacker can control the destination of the request. For example, the attacker could specify a URL that points to a malicious server. When the user visits the web page, the application will make a request to the malicious server, which could be used to steal the user's credentials or install malware on their computer.To prevent SSRF attacks, web applications should validate all user-supplied input. This includes the URL of any resources that are being requested. The application should only allow requests to trusted, authorized servers.",
