    section: Verify that the principle of least privilege exists - users should only
      be able to access functions, data files, URLs, controllers, services, and other
      resources, for which they possess specific authorization. This implies protection
      against spoofing and elevation of privilege. ([C7](https://owasp.org/www-project-proactive-controls/#div-numbering))
