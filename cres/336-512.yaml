    section: Verify that the application has protection from subdomain takeovers if
      the application relies upon DNS entries or DNS subdomains, such as expired domain
      names, out of date DNS pointers or CNAMEs, expired projects at public source
      code repos, or transient cloud APIs, serverless functions, or storage buckets
      (*autogen-bucket-id*.cloud.example.com) or similar. Protections can include
      ensuring that DNS names used by applications are regularly checked for expiry
      or change.
