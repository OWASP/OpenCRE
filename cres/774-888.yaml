    section: Verify passwords, integrations with databases and third-party systems,
      seeds and internal secrets, and API keys are managed securely and not included
      in the source code or stored within source code repositories. Such storage SHOULD
      resist offline attacks. The use of a secure software key store (L1), hardware
      TPM, or an HSM (L3) is recommended for password storage.
