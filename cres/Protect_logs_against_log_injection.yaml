    description: '"Upgrade Log4j2 to version 2.15.0 or newer. In previous releases
      (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property ''log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups''
      to ''true'' or by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example:
      zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).
      Java 8u121 (see https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html)
      protects against remote code execution by defaulting ''com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase''
      and ''com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase'' to ''false''."'
