    section: Verify that secure notifications are sent to users after updates to authentication
      details, such as credential resets, email or address changes, logging in from
      unknown or risky locations. The use of push notifications - rather than SMS
      or email - is preferred, but in the absence of push notifications, SMS or email
      is acceptable as long as no sensitive information is disclosed in the notification.
