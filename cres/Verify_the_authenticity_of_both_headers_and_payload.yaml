    section: V13.2.6
    sectionID: Verify that the message headers and payload are trustworthy and not
      modified in transit. Requiring strong encryption for transport (TLS only) may
      be sufficient in many cases as it provides both confidentiality and integrity
      protection. Per-message digital signatures can provide additional assurance
      on top of the transport protections for high-security applications but bring
      with them additional complexity and risks to weigh against the benefits.
