    section: Verify that an additional iteration of a key derivation function is performed,
      using a salt value that is secret and known only to the verifier. Generate the
      salt value using an approved random bit generator [SP 800-90Ar1] and provide
      at least the minimum security strength specified in the latest revision of SP
      800-131A. The secret salt value SHALL be stored separately from the hashed passwords
      (e.g., in a specialized device like a hardware security module).
