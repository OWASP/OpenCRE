    sectionID: Verify that anti-automation controls are effective at mitigating breached
      credential testing, brute force, and account lockout attacks. Such controls
      include blocking the most common breached passwords, soft lockouts, rate limiting,
      CAPTCHA, ever increasing delays between attempts, IP address restrictions, or
      risk-based restrictions such as location, first login on a device, recent attempts
      to unlock the account, or similar. Verify that no more than 100 failed attempts
      per hour is possible on a single account.
