    section: Verify that the message headers and payload are trustworthy and not modified
      in transit. Requiring strong encryption for transport (TLS only) may be sufficient
      in many cases as it provides both confidentiality and integrity protection.
      Per-message digital signatures can provide additional assurance on top of the
      transport protections for high-security applications but bring with them additional
      complexity and risks to weigh against the benefits.
