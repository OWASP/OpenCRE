    section: Verify that passwords are stored in a form that is resistant to offline
      attacks. Passwords SHALL be salted and hashed using an approved one-way key
      derivation or password hashing function. Key derivation and password hashing
      functions take a password, a salt, and a cost factor as inputs when generating
      a password hash. (C6)
