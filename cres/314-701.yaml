    section: Verify that the web tier is configured to serve only files with specific
      file extensions to prevent unintentional information and source code leakage.
      For example, backup files (e.g. .bak), temporary working files (e.g. .swp),
      compressed files (.zip, .tar.gz, etc) and other extensions commonly used by
      editors should be blocked unless required.
