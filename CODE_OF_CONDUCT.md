## Reporting

If you believe someone has violated this Code of Conduct, please report it. Reports will be handled with discretion and in line with the project’s commitment to a safe and respectful environment.

- **How to report:** Contact the project maintainers (e.g. via the repository’s contact or maintainer information, or through OWASP channels if applicable). For serious or sensitive matters, you may refer to the [OWASP Whistleblower & Anti-Retaliation Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/whistleblower.html).
